## Generate Faces
  
  In this project, we used a dataset containing images of real faces to train a DCGAN that creates a set of images of fake faces. 
  
  Loading the data & preprocessing it, designing the generator & discriminator for the DCGAN, optimization, training, testing, results, and recommendations are included in the Jupyter Notebook. 
  
  The problem_unittests.py is a script that runs unit tests on the generator and discriminator to ensure the components are functioning as intended. The workspace_utils.py is utilized to keep the Jupyter workspace active and not shut down during training.

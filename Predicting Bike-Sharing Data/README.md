# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data

In this project, we approached a prediction problem on bike-sharing usage data to predict daily rental numbers using a fully connected neural network built from scratch.

We started with visualizing the data and minimally restructure it to feed into the neural network. The network is imported, trained, validated, and tested in the Jupyter notebook.

One issue with our predictions with the model is the performance around holiday time, since the trend was not included in the training set and hence was not captured during training. One solution would be to include the data from previous years to the training dataset, which might help it in catching the downward trend in rentals around the holidays.

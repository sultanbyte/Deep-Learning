# Deep Learning Nanodegree (Udacity)

This repository includes the projects I worked on during the course of the Deep Learning nanodegree program by Udacity. The nanodegree is a self-paced four months-long program that focuses on the deep learning aspect of machine learning and its application using PyTorch. 

The projects I worked on during the program are as follows(to be updated as I finish more projects):

## 1) Predicting Bike-Sharing Data
  Designing a fully-connected neural network from scratch, trained on bike-sharing rental data, to predict future rentals.
  
## 2) Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media
  Designing a convolutional neural network from scratch, as well as utilizing transfer-learning, trained on images of a number of landmarks, to recognize those landmarks from different testing images.

## 3) Generate TV Script
  Designing a recurrent neural network to generate a "fake" TV script trained on scripts of Seinfeld episodes. 
  
## 4) Generate Faces
  Designing a DCGAN trained on images of real faces to generate a set of "fake" faces
